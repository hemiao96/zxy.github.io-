Position:

PhD Candidate

Personal Statement
======
Since my second year of undergraduate (2016/12-2017/12), I joined the research group of Professor Liu Xuemei of the College of Life Sciences of Northeast Forestry University to study and conduct experiments. During this year, I participated in “Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities” funding project (2572015EA05) and further consolidated my familiarity with basic molecular biology techniques such as: PCR, constructing plasmid vectors, Agrobacterium-mediated transfection for Arabidopsis thaliana and betula leaves, etc. And also I reviewed and collated the literature on SPL, and published a review. I also published 2 English articles during my time as a research assistant. 

In my fourth year of university, with excellent scores and performance, I was sent to Nankai University to study for a doctorate. I participated in Chinese National Natural Science Foundation (NSFC31530027, 31701284, 31470779) and National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFA0102600]. In my four-year research life, I mainly studied the regulatory mechanism of RA-induced three-dimensional chromatin structure in embryonic stem cell development and differentiation, employing the CRISPR/Cas9, RNAi system, qPCR, RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, 4C-seq, Capture C, HiChIP, Western blot and so on, and I published 3 articles in Nucleic Acids Research,Stem Cells And Development.
