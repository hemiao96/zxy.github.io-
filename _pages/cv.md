Education
======
* Ph.D. Candidate in Department of Cell Biology in College of Life Sciences (State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology), Nankai University       09/2018-
* Bachelor of Science in Department of Biotechnology in College of Life Sciences, Northeast Forestry University        09/2014-06/2018

Research experience
======
* 09/2018--: Ph.D. Candidate, Will graduate in 2023 summer
   * College of Life Sciences (State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology), Nankai University
   * Participated in Chinese National Natural Science Foundation (NSFC31530027, 31701284, 31470779) and National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFA0102600] 
   * Employed CRISPR/Cas9 in ESCs deleting Rara/Rxra (RA receptors), enhancers and RAREs, and analyzed RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and Capture C, found that enhancer architecture-dependent multilayered transcriptional regulation at the Halr1–Hoxa1 locus orchestrating RA signaling-induced early lineage differentiation of ESCs. The results published in Nucleic Acids Research (2021, Vol. 49, No. 20. [doi: 10.1093/nar/gkab1001](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkab1001)).
   * Analyzed ChIP-seq and 4C-seq, identified two enhancers that were activated by RA treatment and 4C data showed long-range interactions between HoxB genes and the two enhancers. The results published in Stem Cells And Development (2021, Vol. 30, No. 13, [doi: 10.1089/scd.2021.0020](https://doi.org/10.1089/scd.2021.0020)).
   * Constructed Skap2 knockdown cell lines using RNAi system, extracted RNA, synthesed cDNA and performed qRT-PCR, extracted protein and carried out Western Blot, and related data analysis were published in Nucleic Acids Research (2019, Vol. 47, No. 13. [doi: 10.1093/nar/gkz482](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkz482)).
   * Employed CRISPR/Cas9 in ESCs deleting Hoxa2, differentiated ESCs by forming embryoid bodies, perforemed qPCR and analyzed the change of lineage marker genes expression, completed undergraduate thesis “The role of Hoxa2 gene in Differentiation of Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells”

  * Supervisor: Prof.Dr.WanGe Lv
